How to Run
----------

`npm install` should install your node modules in the `node_modules/` folder.

`npm install -g bower` should install bower to your global path.

`bower install` should install your front end models in the `assets/libs/` folder.

Then you should be able to run `./bin/www` to get the server running at `localhost:3000/`

Testing
-------
Testing files are located in the `app/tests` folder. 

To run the tests you need to do two steps:

1. Run `npm start` to get the server running. 
2. Open [http://localhost:3000/tests/SpecRunner.html](http://localhost:3000/tests/SpecRunner.html) in your browser. The output should appear there.
